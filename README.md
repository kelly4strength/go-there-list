# golists

## Description

goLists is a web app that allows users to create and share lists of their favorite places in their favorite cities.

goLists was created to help people share their favorite spots with each other in a simple way. Rather than email friends all the places they should visit in a city, users can make a comprehensive list that they can add to at any time. Each list item can be copied into a new list by other users to visit at a later date.
